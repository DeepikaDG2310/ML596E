DO NOT INSTALL. Disgusting. Used to play this in Facebook games Era and now it's become a paywall game like every other gross money hungry game in the app store. Levels passed 50 completely unplayable without power ups which you can only buy with fake currency you have to buy. Want money for any and every action in the game and the fact its geared towards kids and they have store options up to $100 is sickening. Uninstalling for good.,not-safe
"This game is only for gents, not for kids. Due to sexual advertisements are podcasts too much and no option to report or stop these advertisements. So, everyone must and should don't install this game to your child. And also when getting extra moves and powers at the time of end with advertisements it shows the black screen and not responding until clearing this game in recent list. I never saw this kind of worst thing.",not-safe

Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,not-safe
A great way to keep track of honey do lists. We just had our first child and both my wife and I are mentally exhausted so it is easy to let things slip through the cracks. The shared project is great for us to communicate even if we are on different sleep schedules. I just wish there was a way to pin the current project to be the first thing that opens up instead of the daily view of the current day. Would definitely recommend.,Safe

Because these plants have been moved in the pro version section.

Are u kidding me????",not-safe
"I used to love this app so much but after the update I just want to uninstall it. Before the update every tree can be traded with the coins, but after the update almost every tree is the pro version. I'm extremely dissapointed with the updates.

"This app was really great at the beginning. I really like the idea of it. But it has been some time now that I have started to notice some issues: - It has become very slow. Like it is not THAT slow, but for an app that is meant to be used all day long almost every day - I'm a full time student ;) - it does feel a little slow. - It has difficulties updating the time you spend studying in the ""friends"" window. My friends and I always have to go into the settings to make it update the time. Now I do not know if this is because of some android interrupt restrictions, but it would be great if you guys can fix this, because it simply makes the app less trustworthy. - Can we plzzzzz have more trees?? At the beginning the trees were very interesting to buy and to plant. But now I notice that even though most of the trees are fictional, they still are a little boring. And there aren't that many of them to begin with.",not-safe
"It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",not-safe

"I think that this app is honestly really fun!! and for an unmotivated student like me, this gives me more motivation to study but this app has limited rewards and it takes very long to get enough coins to buy new trees so the forest becomes boring after awhile.

"Honestly, this app really helps students like me amidst this pandemic. The UI is user-friendly, the trees are cute and the mechanics are A-okay. I think there are still points that can be updated just like trees can have small animations, new forest landscapes and a bit of interaction with the forest. It may stray away from its purpose of focusing but the feeling of completion gives me satisfaction. Last is how free users access the types of trees. I'm sure that you don't want them to be lost.",Safe

"this is the first ever app that im willing to unlock any pro version! firstly, aside from the functions of pro, the app has a great variety of functions which allows me to stay concentrated even my phone is just with me! moreover the pro version is even more user friendly and price-efficient, it doesnt create any burden even to a normal student cause it's an one-off with a low price!",Safe
"I used to be a study skills tutor, and I commonly recommended this to students who struggled to stay off their phones or needed a focus timer. Forest is visually appealing, motivating, and user friendly. Unlike many other apps of its type, it doesn't induce shame; someone can go back to their phone in an emergency, they just lose the tree. It also allows for easy time tracking, amd for students to play music/spotify throughout the period (so long as they don't adjust). Love this app!",Safe
"I ADORE this app. It's great for people (like me) who need some incentive to keep working! I'm a college kid, and every time I study, I log it on Forest. When I look over the app and see all of the trees, bushes, and flowers that I planted, it makes me really proud! It's definitely a sense of accomplishment. And the team that made this app are doing amazing things with reforestation! What's not to like??",Safe
This app is very useful for me as a student to focus and to get some work done. It costs like 1 or 2 dollars to unlock the full app. (When we waste so much money on other stuff i guess this isn't a much price to pay.) Anyways happiest thing is that I'm able to contribute to a real planting campaign through this app. I highly recommend this app. Very satisfied.,Safe
"Absolutely love this app. Just wish the trees were a little cheaper in coins so they were easier to get. At the moment it takes me a month to get a new one. But at least that means I have to stay committed! The app is so cute, would highly recommend to anyone, especially students. Been doing a lot more uni work since I got this!!",Safe
I decided to try this app for myself and for my kid. I have trouble both focusing and staying on task due to health reasons & autism and my kid has ADHD and autism This has helped a LOT. My kid started secondary school in Sept & was struggling to focus while doing homework. The app has helped tremendously and instead of it taking 2+ hours with constant reminders from me to focus it is down to less than an hour and I rarely have to remind them they're doing homework. Great app!,Safe

Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab?

"Would've given five star if: we were given points for completing tasks and there was a daily goal feature. (It kind of motivates the students to reach their daily goals.) Well, I'm a student so this is from my point of view. This is what I think, as a student, should be in a to-do list app. Even something similar shall do the job. Currently uninstalling the app, but with a hope that the creators will consider my point and do the needful. Thank you.",not-safe

It will allow us to see what we have planned in each category/list. I'm a student / young professional, and believe me, these would be killer features.",Safe

"I never write reviews but I love this app! I have tried a couple to-do listapps before and never found them really helpful. As a law student I need to keep track of a bunch of things and this app makes wrangling assignments, meetings and tasks so simple. I like that in addition to having your daily tasks there is a list making feature. It's also just plain fun to use. You have the option to change the theme and you get the perfectly satisfying ding sound when you check off a task.",Safe

So far this app has all what I am looking for. It is easy to use and overall the app is great especially for students who wanted to organize their tasks. It has themes to choose from by changing its color and background if you wanted to change the interface and theme of your to do list.,Safe
"I hope that users, if they want to record those tasks that aren't added but already accomplished, can also add the exact date & time of its accomplishment/submission just so users (i.e. students, etc.) can keep track on what they've recently accomplished/submitted with, more importantly, the exact date & time. Teachers, for instance, sometimes get confuse upon checking submitted documents and would rather ask the students when it was submitted, especially if passed online for fast retrieval.",Safe
"As a student I have tried a lot of task reminder or to do list but honestly this is he best one hands down. It hits every thing that a student could need and it's so organized. If you are student you must try ths app regardless if you need it or not, you will not regret it. It is also very custimaizable. And even if you are not a stdent you must try this for eg: you are a person with a buisy schedule. And even if you are going to the groceries this is there for you",Safe

Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",Safe
"I really like this app for my phone. My favorite part is the voice notification. It really helps with my kids homeschooling. I set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table, then it plays a little song. I love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons, put their dishes in the sink, grab their notebooks then sit at the table. I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore. The only thing I would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises. Like how google does with their calendar app. Other than that I really like this app.",Safe
"Great app to plan out your weekly schedule, especially for a college student. However I wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget.

"Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates. Also the interface and look (big text and colours) looks like a children's calender, while the original version actually looked quite professional.",not-safe

Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for.

I think there are still points that can be updated just like trees can have small animations, new forest landscapes and a bit of interaction with the forest.

It also allows for easy time tracking, amd for students to play music/spotify throughout the period (so long as they don't adjust). Love this app!",Safe

"Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates. Also the interface and look (big text and colours) looks like a children's calender, while the original version actually looked quite professional.",not-safe

It's really one of the most horrible game l have ever played .

This is extremely anti-religious and should not be taught to future children.,not-safe

"Subway surfers is a very good game for kids. My kids play it all the time, it is also very good because it is a non internet game so if the area you are in does not have wifi you can just play it. It is also very useful for long plane or car rides.

Everything thing is great but my daughters asks if you can make a new version of Tricky.Thx",Safe

DO NOT INSTALL. Disgusting. Used to play this in Facebook games Era and now it's become a paywall game like every other gross money hungry game in the app store. Levels passed 50 completely unplayable without power ups which you can only buy with fake currency you have to buy. Want money for any and every action in the game and the fact its geared towards kids and they have store options up to $100 is sickening. Uninstalling for good.,not-safe
"This game is only for gents, not for kids. Due to sexual advertisements are podcasts too much and no option to report or stop these advertisements.
